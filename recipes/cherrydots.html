<p>A cookie tradition in my family, Christmas is not complete without our Cherry Dots.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>34 candied cherries</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped walnuts (Optional)/li>
  
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Stir in milk and vanilla extract. Mix in the flour and salt.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into two equal pieces, and shape each half into a 12 inch roll on a sheet of waxed paper. Place 17 candied cherries side by side on top of each roll, and press into the roll until the cherries are centered. Mold dough around cherries. Sprinkle the outside evenly with chopped walnuts. Wrap the dough in the waxed paper, and refrigerate 4 hours to overnight.</li>
